#Goal of the web app :
The web application lets user search for movies actors/actress are know for.

#Basic Info :
The web app basically scrapes the IMDb page corresponding a particular actor and extracts movies the actor is known for.
After getting the name of the movies and its IMDb id, the web app internally extracts the information and reviews of all these movies.

#Languages used :
PHP
HTML/CSS/Javascript

#Basic functional flow of the app :
User enters the name of the actor/actress in search box and hits search button.
The data is recieved and sent from html form to test.php.
The actor/actress name in the input is passed to function getActorInfo($title) in class Imdb.
Inside this function getIMDbIdFromSearch($title),this method searches the given title on Google, Bing or Ask to get the best possible match and extracts the "imdbId" corresponding that actor.

This imdbId is passed to function getActorInfoById($imdbId) which calls scrapeActorInfo($imdbUrl) and scraps the information of actor along with the movies he is known for.

After getting the ids of movie he is know for , function getMovieUrl is called which extracts the url of the movies a particular actor is known for. 
From the url recieved the movieIds are extracted and passed to funtion getMovieById which futher calls scrapeMovieInfo and extracts all the information for the movie.
 
After this process, the data is returned to test.php in an array.
Again a call to get reviews of the movie is made and the title_id or the movieId recieved are passed to function getMovieReview which calls getMovieReview_Inside($imdbUrl) and extracts the reviews and and the user info, an array is returned and used up by function of javascript to display the information in tabular form.
